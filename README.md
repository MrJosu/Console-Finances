# Console-Finances

## Description


This repo is created for module 4 challenge, in this challenge I was using <b>JavaScript</b> and I was working with provided dataset.
I wrote JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
<ul>
<li>The total number of months included in the dataset.

<li>The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

<li>The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

<li>The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

<li>The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

<li>When I open my code in the browser my resulting analysis look like the following screenshot:
